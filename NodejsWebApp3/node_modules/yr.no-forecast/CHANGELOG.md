# CHANGELOG

Dates use DD/MM/YYYY format.


# 1.0.0 26/04/2017
* Change to Promise based interface.
* Make the module a factory function.
* Use `pixl-xml` to increase XML parsing speed and lower memory usage. Yay for
better performance!
* Improved unit tests. Tests no longer require an internet connection.
* Removed `getCurrentSummary` in favour of simply using `getForecastForTime` and
passing the current timestamp. Simplifies API footprint.


# < 1.0.0
* Undocumented. Sorry.
